# Algorithms, 4th ed.
### C Implementations

Grayson Pike, 2016

These programs are C implementations of the algorithms described in Robert Sedgewick's [Alogirthms, 4th ed.](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/).

#### Algorithms Implemented So Far:

*  Quick Find (`quick_find/`)
*  Quick Union (`quick_union/`)
*  Weighted Quick Union (`weighted_quick_union/`)
*  Weighted Quick Union with Path Compression (`pc_weighted_quick_union/`)
*  Matrix Percolation using Weighted Quick Union (`2d_percolation/`)
*  Selection Sort (`selection_sort`)
